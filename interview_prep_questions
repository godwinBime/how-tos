==> Hiring Manager: “Once your app is live in the Google Play Store, how do you monitor its performance and ensure a good user experience?"     

==> Answer: In my current role, once an app is published to the Google Play Store, I rely on the Play Console for client‑side insights like crash reports, ANR rates, device
distribution, and user engagement. But since our backend runs entirely on AWS, I also extend monitoring with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X‑Ray. That gives me
visibility into server‑side performance — API latencies, error rates, and request traces across AppSync, Lambda, and DynamoDB. By combining the two, I get a complete
picture: Play Console shows me how the app behaves on real devices, while AWS observability tools show me how the backend is performing under load. For example, if I see
a spike in ANRs in Play Console, I can correlate it with CloudWatch metrics to determine if it’s tied to backend latency or throttling. This dual approach helps me 
quickly identify root causes and ensure both the frontend experience and backend services are optimized after deployment.

==> Hiring Manager: “Can you share your experience working with AI or other emerging technologies, and how you’ve applied them to deliver real business value?”

==> Yes, I’ve had the opportunity to work with AI in both personal projects and at scale within Amazon. For example, I recently published an AI‑powered Android 
chatbot app called Mini Gem on the Play Store, which uses Google’s Gemini API for multimodal analysis — combining natural language processing and image recognition
to provide context‑aware responses.

In addition to that, I contributed to integrating the Amazon Q API into the AtoZ Employee App. We built an internal chat assistant that allowed employees to ask both 
in‑house HR and policy questions as well as general queries. My role involved designing the Android integration layer, ensuring secure API communication, and optimizing 
the conversational flow for usability. This assistant reduced the load on HR support channels and gave employees faster, self‑service access to information.

These experiences taught me how to balance cutting‑edge AI capabilities with enterprise‑grade reliability, security, and user experience. At Lowe’s, 
I’d be excited to apply the same approach — leveraging AI not just as a novelty, but as a way to solve real problems for associates and customers.

==> Hiring Manager: "what are some GraphQL clients that aws offers because my work experience shows I work only with aws as my cloud provider when working at amazon"

==> In my work at Amazon, I used AWS AppSync as the managed GraphQL service and integrated it with the Amplify GraphQL client on Android. This allowed me to handle 
queries, mutations, and subscriptions with built‑in support for Cognito authentication and offline caching. I also leveraged Amplify DataStore for offline‑first 
workflows, which automatically synced with AppSync when connectivity was restored. This gave me end‑to‑end experience with AWS’s GraphQL ecosystem.

==> Hiring Manager: Can you walk me through a complex Android feature you’ve built and how you ensured it was scalable?

==> One of the most complex features I built was the time card management system at Amazon. It required offline resilience, complex validation, 
and seamless parity with the web platform. I implemented it using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM, with modularized architecture and dependency 
injection to keep the codebase clean and testable. I also added observability with structured logs and performance metrics, which allowed us to monitor 
usage in production. The result was a feature that scaled to millions of employees with a 94.9% crash-free rate, while remaining easy to maintain and extend. 
That experience taught me the importance of clean boundaries and instrumentation, which I’d bring to Lowe’s to ensure long-term scalability.

==> Hiring Manager: How do you approach improving app performance?

==> My approach always starts with measurement. At Amazon, I profiled the app and discovered that inefficient GraphQL queries and redundant recompositions were 
slowing things down. I redesigned the queries, implemented normalized caching, and introduced lazy loading for non-critical data. On the UI side, I optimized 
Compose rendering by eliminating heavy work in composition and memoizing state. I also collaborated with backend teams to simplify endpoints and added automated 
checks in CI for cold start and frame drops. These changes reduced load time by 40% and cut API response times by 50%, which directly improved employee productivity.
I see performance as a product feature, and I’d apply the same rigor at Lowe’s to ensure smooth, reliable mobile experiences.

==> Hiring Manager: How do you mentor junior engineers?

==> Mentorship for me is about both technical guidance and building confidence. At Amazon, I noticed new hires struggled with onboarding, so I created 
structured guides, ran weekly code walkthroughs, and set up a buddy system. I also encouraged juniors to lead root cause analysis sessions and present 
their work in demos, which helped them grow both technically and in communication skills. These efforts reduced onboarding time by about 30% and improved 
team velocity. I believe mentorship scales teams, and at Lowe’s I’d continue fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and growth.
