==> Hiring Manager: “Once your app is live in the Google Play Store, how do you monitor its performance and ensure a good user experience?"     

==> Answer: In my current role, once an app is published to the Google Play Store, I rely on the Play Console for client‑side insights like crash reports, ANR rates, device
distribution, and user engagement. But since our backend runs entirely on AWS, I also extend monitoring with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X‑Ray. That gives me
visibility into server‑side performance — API latencies, error rates, and request traces across AppSync, Lambda, and DynamoDB. By combining the two, I get a complete
picture: Play Console shows me how the app behaves on real devices, while AWS observability tools show me how the backend is performing under load. For example, if I see
a spike in ANRs in Play Console, I can correlate it with CloudWatch metrics to determine if it’s tied to backend latency or throttling. This dual approach helps me 
quickly identify root causes and ensure both the frontend experience and backend services are optimized after deployment.

==> Hiring Manager: “Can you share your experience working with AI or other emerging technologies, and how you’ve applied them to deliver real business value?”

==> Yes, I’ve had the opportunity to work with AI in both personal projects and at scale within Amazon. For example, I recently published an AI‑powered Android 
chatbot app called Mini Gem on the Play Store, which uses Google’s Gemini API for multimodal analysis — combining natural language processing and image recognition
to provide context‑aware responses.

In addition to that, I contributed to integrating the Amazon Q API into the AtoZ Employee App. We built an internal chat assistant that allowed employees to ask both 
in‑house HR and policy questions as well as general queries. My role involved designing the Android integration layer, ensuring secure API communication, and optimizing 
the conversational flow for usability. This assistant reduced the load on HR support channels and gave employees faster, self‑service access to information.

These experiences taught me how to balance cutting‑edge AI capabilities with enterprise‑grade reliability, security, and user experience. At Lowe’s, 
I’d be excited to apply the same approach — leveraging AI not just as a novelty, but as a way to solve real problems for associates and customers.

==> Hiring Manager: "what are some GraphQL clients that aws offers because my work experience shows I work only with aws as my cloud provider when working at amazon"

==> In my work at Amazon, I used AWS AppSync as the managed GraphQL service and integrated it with the Amplify GraphQL client on Android. This allowed me to handle 
queries, mutations, and subscriptions with built‑in support for Cognito authentication and offline caching. I also leveraged Amplify DataStore for offline‑first 
workflows, which automatically synced with AppSync when connectivity was restored. This gave me end‑to‑end experience with AWS’s GraphQL ecosystem.

==> Hiring Manager: Can you walk me through a complex Android feature you’ve built and how you ensured it was scalable?

==> One of the most complex features I built was the time card management system at Amazon. It required offline resilience, complex validation, 
and seamless parity with the web platform. I implemented it using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM, with modularized architecture and dependency 
injection to keep the codebase clean and testable. I also added observability with structured logs and performance metrics, which allowed us to monitor 
usage in production. The result was a feature that scaled to millions of employees with a 94.9% crash-free rate, while remaining easy to maintain and extend. 
That experience taught me the importance of clean boundaries and instrumentation, which I’d bring to Lowe’s to ensure long-term scalability.

==> Hiring Manager: How do you approach improving app performance?

==> My approach always starts with measurement. At Amazon, I profiled the app and discovered that inefficient GraphQL queries and redundant recompositions were 
slowing things down. I redesigned the queries, implemented normalized caching, and introduced lazy loading for non-critical data. On the UI side, I optimized 
Compose rendering by eliminating heavy work in composition and memoizing state. I also collaborated with backend teams to simplify endpoints and added automated 
checks in CI for cold start and frame drops. These changes reduced load time by 40% and cut API response times by 50%, which directly improved employee productivity.
I see performance as a product feature, and I’d apply the same rigor at Lowe’s to ensure smooth, reliable mobile experiences.

==> Hiring Manager: How do you mentor junior engineers?

==> Mentorship for me is about both technical guidance and building confidence. At Amazon, I noticed new hires struggled with onboarding, so I created 
structured guides, ran weekly code walkthroughs, and set up a buddy system. I also encouraged juniors to lead root cause analysis sessions and present 
their work in demos, which helped them grow both technically and in communication skills. These efforts reduced onboarding time by about 30% and improved 
team velocity. I believe mentorship scales teams, and at Lowe’s I’d continue fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and growth.

##################################################

==> Hiring Manager: Tell me about a time you worked with other teams to deliver a unified solution.

==> At Amazon, I partnered with the web team to align on APIs and design patterns so we could achieve 90% feature parity across platforms. We held regular syncs, 
shared design documents, and created a joint backlog for cross-platform features. I also worked closely with backend teams to version APIs and avoid breaking changes.
This collaboration ensured employees had a consistent experience whether they used the web or mobile app, and it reduced duplicate support content. At Lowe’s, 
I’d bring the same collaborative approach to ensure seamless experiences across mobile, web, and backend systems.

##################################################

==> Hiring Manager: What’s your experience with CI/CD and automation?

==> I’ve led several initiatives to improve delivery speed and reliability. At Amazon, I optimized Gradle builds, introduced build caching, 
and split pipelines into parallel stages for linting, unit tests, and instrumentation. I automated device-farm runs for critical flows and set up canary rollouts 
with telemetry dashboards to monitor crash rates and performance. These changes reduced deployment time from 45 to 15 minutes and cut QA cycle time from five days 
to three, while also reducing post-release bugs by 40%. At Lowe’s, I’d focus on similar automation and observability practices to accelerate delivery while 
maintaining high reliability.

##################################################

==> Hiring Manager: How do you approach designing Android systems for long-term sustainability?

==> I focus on clean architecture principles like MVVM, modularization, and clear separation of concerns. At Amazon, I migrated legacy features to Jetpack Compose,
which reduced the codebase size by 30% and cut maintenance time by 45%. I standardized state handling, dependency injection, and testing strategies, and I built 
observability into the system with logging and metrics that tied frontend events to backend requests. These practices made the system easier to scale and maintain 
over time. At Lowe’s, I’d apply the same approach to ensure Android systems remain reliable and adaptable as the business grows.

##################################################

==> Hiring Manager: how do you optimize loading in a backend api.

==> To reduce the app loading time by 40%, we identified a complex user data fetch. We refactored the Android query to use GraphQL with AppSync, 
allowing us to precisely request only the five required fields. On the backend, we implemented AppSync Response Caching for the static fields and ensured
the DynamoDB tables had optimized Global Secondary Indexes aligned with the new GraphQL query pattern. We then used Provisioned Concurrency on the backing 
Lambda to eliminate cold starts for this critical path. This combination cut the end-to-end latency significantly.
